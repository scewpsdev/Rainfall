SEQUENCE
Level starts with player wondering where they are
Realising theyre in a prison
First goal: try to figure out where we are and how to get out
Prison cell section
	Initially player feels stuck
	Then they see a gap in the wall and some objects to climb on
	Player escapes to the neighboring cell, where the door has broken down
	The direct way outside through the main door is locked
	NPCs in some of the other cells (freeing them rewards you with helpful items)
	Player has to find another way out
	Multiple directions to go in the beginning
	Prison is full of traps
	Paths all end up in the same room eventually
	Player finds a torch they can use to navigate through a dark area
	An explosive barrel can be blown up to create a hole in the wall that leads out of the cell block through a cave system
	Player finds stashed basic weapon and some food to heal up
	A hole in the cave ceiling indicates youre close to the surface (maybe an elevated bridge that teases a later section?)
	Simple enemies to fight and teach basic combat (rats, bats, spider)
	Sconces to light up the area
	The cave loops back to the prison
	A prison key can be looted from a dead guard
	The player can now open the locked door from the outside
	This rewards the player with an indirect checkpoint and allows them to free the NPCs (sending them to the hub area)
Living area
	Player enters part of the dungeon that people used to live in (living rooms, armory, library)
	Clothes and simple armor to loot
	Books and notes that teach you about the lore of the place
	Place for a quick rest (fireplace?)
	First proper checkpoint
	Gate that leads outside back to the caves
Cave section
	Smarter enemies with movesets
	Enemies can drop proper weapons and armor
	Player now gets to the outer parts of area closer to the surface
	Introduce enemies with alternative combat strategies that render a brute force approach ineffective
	Give the player more tools to deal with different kinds of threats (shield to block arrows, kicking to break stance, throwables to attract enemies individually or weaken them before engaging in melee combat, using the environment to take out groups of enemies)
	Safe region to cool down
Boss fight to test what the player has learned (Stone golem with a big club that wakes up when you try to leave?)
Level ends with player escaping to the overworld (-> sense of relief)
